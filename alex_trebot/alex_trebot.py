        'My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a 15-year-old French prostitute named Chloe, with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we\'d make meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard really. At the age of 12, I received my first scribe. At the age of 14, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum. It\'s breathtaking. I suggest you try it.',

          'When you\'re in your 30s and actively pursuing a career and a home life, a wife and children, you\'re busy doing as opposed to busy thinking. As you get older, even as you don\'t have as much time, I think you tend to think more and reflect more on what is happening in your own life.',
          'The only reason I got into broadcasting was, I needed money to pay for my junior and senior years at college, and they hired me, those fools!',
          'Sex? Unfortunately, as you get older - and I shouldn\'t admit this - there are other things that become more important in your daily life.',
